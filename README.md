## Technical details
[Wrench distribution](https://isri-aist.github.io/ForceControlCollection/doxygen/classForceColl_1_1WrenchDistribution.html#details) is a common method in robot control that, given a resultant wrench, calculates the equivalent contact wrench at the contact patches. For example, section III.B of the following paper describes the formulas for wrench distribution.
